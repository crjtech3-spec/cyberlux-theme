# Theme settings reference

This file documents the top-level `config/settings_schema.json` groups and where to find them in the Theme Editor.

## Top-level categories
- `Favicon & Logo` — logo, favicon, and logo sizing.
- `Typography` — heading, body and accent font/presets and sizes.
- `Design System` — global design preset, spacing, radius, shadow.
- `Colors` — curated palettes and manual color overrides.
- `Layout & Spacing` — page width, grid spacing, border and line options.
- `Header & Navigation` — header layout, menu behavior, sticky header.
- `Footer` — footer columns, newsletter, social links.
- `Product & Cart` — product gallery, PDP layout, cart drawer/page.
- `Checkout & Password` — password page settings and gift card behaviour.
- `Accessibility & Performance` — skip links, screen-reader helpers, lazy-loading toggles.

## Where to edit
Open `Online Store > Themes > Customize` then select `Theme settings` in the left sidebar.

## Developer notes
- `theme_info` (in `settings_schema.json`) includes `theme_documentation_url` and `theme_support_url` that link to this documentation and to the issue tracker.
- Keep `theme_author` and `theme_version` intact — they are used by Shopify Theme Store metadata.
