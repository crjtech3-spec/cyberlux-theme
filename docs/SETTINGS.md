# Theme settings — merchant-focused reference

This page explains the main Theme settings you will use as a store admin. Settings are grouped in the Theme Editor under `Theme settings`.

## Key settings and where to find them
- Favicon & Logo
  - Change site logo and favicon. Logo width slider controls header sizing.
- Colors
  - Choose a color palette (preset) or select `Custom` and edit individual colors.
  - Important colors: `Solid Button Background`, `Solid Button Label`, `Text`, `Background`.
- Typography
  - Heading and body fonts, base sizes and line heights.
  - Use Typography to adjust global legibility quickly.
- Layout & Spacing
  - `Page width` influences content max-width; `Grid spacing` controls card gutters.
- Header & Navigation
  - Toggle sticky header, enable announcement bar, configure menus.
- Footer
  - Configure footer columns, newsletter block, and social links.
- Product & Cart
  - PDP gallery layout (carousel / stacked), enable `sticky-add-to-cart` and `cart-drawer`.

## Common merchant tasks (how to change these settings)
- Make CTAs more prominent: `Theme settings > Colors` → increase contrast for `Solid Button Background`.
- Change the site type scale: `Theme settings > Typography > Base Size`.
- Reduce whitespace: `Theme settings > Layout & Spacing > Grid spacing`.
