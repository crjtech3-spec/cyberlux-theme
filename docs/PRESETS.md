# Presets & demo stores

Cyber Lux ships with five demo presets: **Cyberluxe**, **Luxe**, **Minimal**, **Noir**, **Sunset**. Each preset includes curated home, collection and product JSON templates under `listings/<preset>/`.

## How to preview a preset
1. From the Theme Editor choose `Theme actions > Change theme settings` or import the preset `listings/<preset>/index.*.json`.
2. Verify demo content (collections, products, images) in a demo store.

## Demo store guidance (for Theme Store submission)
- Provide realistic product data (no Lorem Ipsum).
- Tag the demo store with the matching industry category and catalog size.
- Ensure collection/product pages contain representative images and structured content.

## Preset-to-category mapping (recommended)
- Cyberluxe → Fashion
- Luxe → Jewelry
- Minimal → Home
- Noir → Fashion (dark-premium)
- Sunset → Beauty
