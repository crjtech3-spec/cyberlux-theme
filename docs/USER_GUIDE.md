## Theme settings — where to find them and why they matter
- Favicon & Logo — appearance across the store
- Typography — controls fonts and base sizes; affects all headings and text
- Colors — choose a preset palette or edit specific color values
- Layout & Spacing — page width and spacing scale (controls overall rhythm)
- Header & Navigation — logo position, announcement bar, sticky header
- Footer — columns, social links, newsletter
- Product & Cart — PDP layout (gallery vs stacked), cart drawer behaviors

Merchant examples
- To make CTAs more visible: use `Colors > Solid Button Background` contrasted against text.
- To increase legibility: `Typography > Body Base Size` + `Line Height` adjustments.

## Presets & demo content
Presets: Cyberluxe (Fashion), Luxe (Jewelry), Minimal (Home), Noir (Dark premium), Sunset (Beauty). Each preset includes curated layouts and demo content — use them as starting points.

## FAQs
Q: Can I remove sections from the homepage? — Yes. Use the Theme Editor and click `Remove` on any section.
Q: Are there developer tools I need to run? — No — merchants manage the theme via the Theme Editor. Developer tools were removed from the merchant docs.
